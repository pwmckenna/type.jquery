#type.jquery

This is not performant by any means, and addresses no pain point other than a thought I had on Bart. 

Text is typed into dom elements, and as it is being typed (and I assumed a solo typist), multiple calls to type will result in serial execution.

This project was also intended to be a experimentation with jQuery Deferred objects...so the implementation is pretty ridiculous, but I learned a bunch...
